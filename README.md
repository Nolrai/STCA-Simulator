Forked from dixons-57/STCA-Simulator

# STCA Simulator
 A tool for examining and simulating the effects of various reversible and irreversible Self-Timed Cellular Automata. Created in support of PhD thesis. 

It requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to be installed on your system. It has been tested extensively in multiple versions of
Microsoft Windows, but should also run on any Unix-like system provided the JRE is installed. To run, launch the command "java Launch" 
from inside the main directory (the directory containing Launch.class). To launch on Windows, you may simply double click the included 
Run.bat

The program includes examples of configurations from the four STCA introduced in the thesis.

For more details on the technical aspects of the software, and the underlying theoretical principles, please consult the doctoral thesis titled:
